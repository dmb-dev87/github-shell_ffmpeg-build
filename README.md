Static audio-only FFmpeg builds
===============================

This project contains scripts for small static audio-only FFmpeg builds that are used
for Chromaprint packaging. There are binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit Intel CPUs are supported on all platforms.
Linux build is also done on ARMv6 (e.g. Raspberry Pi).
